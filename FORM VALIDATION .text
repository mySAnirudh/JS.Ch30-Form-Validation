Form validation normally used to occur at the server, after the client had 
entered all the necessary data and then pressed the Submit button. If the data 
entered by a client was incorrect or was simply missing, the server would have 
to send all the data back to the client and request that the form be resubmitted 
with correct information. This was really a lengthy process which used to put a 
lot of burden on the server. 
JavaScript provides a way to validate form's data on the client's computer before 
sending it to the web server. Form validation generally performs two functions.
 Basic Validation - First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all 
the mandatory fields are filled in. It would require just a loop through 
each field in the form and check for data.
 Data Format Validation - Secondly, the data that is entered must be 
checked for correct form and value. Your code must include appropriate 
logic to test correctness of data.
